          <h2>The Project</h2>
          <p>The project aims to develop teachers’ thinking about how children learn to write creatively and to improve the teaching and learning of spelling, punctuation and grammar, the expectation for which have increased with the introduction of the new National Curriculum.</p>
          <p>Between May 2016 and June 2017 the project will bring together 24 teachers who will work with established lesson study Lead Practitioners (based in Lambeth Schools) and specialists from UCL Institute of Education. The lesson study process involves repeated cycles of collaborative planning and opportunities to observe research lessons. The project will culminate in a conference and good practice publication in summer 2017.</p>

          <p>There is a wide base of evidence for lesson study as an effective approach to improving teacher quality. More information here: https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/projects/edge-hill-university/

   Subject Knowledge Hubs 

Following on from the successful delivery of the Mayor’s London Schools Excellence Fund, the Greater London Authority is funding 18 subject specific teaching and learning hubs to sustain and embed the good practice developed through the programme.

This legacy funding will enable continued coordination of subject specific hubs and networks that were central to many London Schools Excellence Fund projects.  The hubs will provide the opportunity for teachers from a range of schools to work together alongside subject and business experts to support excellent teaching in London schools through a strong focus on improving teachers subject knowledge. 

Delivery is taking place between January 2016 and August 2017.

See the LSEF Resource Hub for more information on Subject Knowledge Hubs and contact details.
