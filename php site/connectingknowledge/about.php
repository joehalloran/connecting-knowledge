          <h2>Lesson Study</h2>
            <p class="first-par">Lesson Study is an approach to professional learning used in some of the most successful education systems globally.</p>
 			<p>Lesson study is about working with experts for sustained, collaborative professional learning through:</p>
 			<ul>
 				<li>The creation (by teachers) of robust evaluation frameworks focusing on specific pupils and &#47; or areas for development.</li>
				<li>Collaborative lesson planning.</li>
				<li>Lesson observations focused on pupil learning, usually focused on specific groups of pupils.</li>
				<li>Collaborative reflections on pupil learning.</li>
				<li>Applying the learning from the lesson study cycle to improve outcomes for pupils.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Lesson study is not for performance management or judgements about lesson quality.</p>
