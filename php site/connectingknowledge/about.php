          <h2>Lesson Study</h2>
	        <p class="first-par">Lesson Study is an approach to professional learning used in some of the most successful education systems globally.</p>
			<p>Lesson study is about working with experts for sustained, collaborative professional learning through:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The creation (by teachers) of robust evaluation frameworks focusing on specific pupils and &#47; or areas for development.</li>
				<li>Collaborative lesson planning.</li>
				<li>Lesson observations focused on pupil learning, usually focused on specific groups of pupils.</li>
				<li>Collaborative reflections on pupil learning.</li>
				<li>Applying the learning from the lesson study cycle to improve outcomes for pupils.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Lesson study is not for performance management or judgements about lesson quality.</p> 
			<p>There is a wide base of evidence for lesson study as an effective approach to improving teacher quality. More information here: <a href="https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/evaluation/projects/lesson-study/" target="_blank">Education Endowment Foundation</a>
